The ECO4 Scheme:
    The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a government initiative addressing fuel poverty and reducing carbon emissions
     in Great Britain. ECO4, the latest iteration, runs from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2026.

    Eligible households, especially those in fuel poverty, can access a variety of energy improvements, emphasizing a
    whole-house retrofit approach. A survey ensures suitability for improvements.

How ECO4 Works:
    The scheme places a Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation (HHCRO) on major energy suppliers. They promote measures
    to improve heating in low-income households, reducing energy usage and carbon emissions.

Funding:
    Major energy suppliers fund ECO4 to enhance energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions across the UK.

Target Audience:
    ECO4 supports energy efficiency measures for homeowners or tenants in fuel poverty. Eligible customers must undergo
    a survey to access improvements.

Importance of Good Insulation:
    Loft insulation can reduce energy bills by up to Â£215 per year. Our survey assesses existing insulation, which, if
    less than 100mm, can be increased for improved efficiency lasting up to 40 years.

Measures Funded:
    ECO4 funding covers measures like Cavity Wall Insulation, Gas Boiler Replacement, Heating Controls Upgrade, and more.

Eligibility Criteria:
    To qualify, customers must receive benefits such as:
        I. Income-based Job Seekers Allowance
        II. Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
        III. Income Support

ELLIE: Hi there! How can I assist you today regarding the ECO IV scheme?

USER: I need help signing up to the scheme, but before we get into that,
      could you please tell me a lot more about the scheme

ELLIE: The ECO IV scheme is a government energy efficiency program in
       Great Britain aimed at reducing fuel poverty and carbon emissions.
       It requires energy suppliers to participate and provide energy
       improvements for low-income, fuel-poor, and vulnerable households.
       The scheme focuses on a whole-house retrofit approach, meaning
       multiple areas of improvement must be delivered rather than just one.
       Eligibility is based on certain benefits, and an initial remote
       assessment of your property will be conducted to determine eligibility
       and any potential upfront customer contribution. If you're interested
       in applying, we'll need some details about your property and the
       benefits you're receiving.

USER: What information do you need about my property ?

ELLIE: To proceed with your ECO application, we will need some information about
       your property. This includes details such as the type of property you own
       or rent, the size of the property, and its energy efficiency. Additionally,
       we will require information about the benefits you are currently receiving.
       If you're ready to provide these details, we can begin the application process.

USER: I am ready. Let's begin.

ELLIE: Great! Let's get started with your ECO IV application. To begin, we'll need
       some information about your property. This includes details such as the type
       and size of your property, as well as its current energy efficiency. We'll
       also require information about the benefits you are currently receiving.
       Please keep in mind that costs will not be known until your property has been
       fully assessed, and any additional costs will be included in the installer's
       quote. Work will not commence without your full consent. Once we have all the
       necessary details, we'll proceed with the application.

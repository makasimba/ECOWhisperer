The ECO4 UK-Home Grant eligibility check can only be conducted under the benefit recipient's name. Would you like to proceed on your own behalf or on behalf of someone else?

The ECO initiative has been specifically crafted to assist households, particularly those most vulnerable, in enhancing their energy efficiency. Through local authority referrals, entities such as UK Energy Support collaborate diligently with Ofgem and energy suppliers to ensure the stringent standards of the Energy Company Obligation Scheme are met.
Do you agree that we may:

1. Share your details with Energy Saving Trust for Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and/or The Great British Insulation
 Scheme (GBIS) for eligibility check, so they can provide services to us.

2. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) via the Energy Saving Trust to verify your eligibility for this
 assistance.

3. Share your details with Ofgem, the Scheme Administrator, for project review.

4. Receive limited information relating to your entitlement from the DWP.

5. Check your property's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rate (please note, only properties with lower energy
 efficiency ratings will be processed).

Please be aware that you need to have the beneficiary's permission to use their personal details per the GDPR (UK) regulation, and we will confirm that later in the process.

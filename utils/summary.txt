The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is a UK government initiative addressing
fuel poverty and carbon emissions. Mandating participation from energy
suppliers, the scheme's fourth iteration, ECO4, runs from April 2022 to March
2026. Emphasizing holistic upgrades, ECO4 requires fabric insulation before
considering other measures, deviating from a singular focus on boiler replacements.

Implemented through a Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation (HHCRO), medium
and large energy suppliers must promote measures benefiting low-income households,
like insulation or heating system upgrades. Eligibility hinges on strict criteria
tied to specific benefits.

The Great British Insulation Scheme, part of ECO, offers two application groups—general
and low-income—each with distinct eligibility criteria. The general group considers
council tax bands and EPC ratings, while the low-income group requires benefit recipients
in less efficient housing.

Applicants undergo an initial remote assessment, followed by a comprehensive evaluation
and quote. While an upfront customer contribution may be necessary, the amount is
determined post-survey. Privately rented properties with benefit-receiving tenants
require written landlord permission.

Acknowledging receipt within five days, there's no guaranteed progression to installation.
If successful, the installer contacts applicants within four weeks. ECO strives for energy
efficiency, focusing on those in fuel poverty, contributing to broader carbon reduction goals.
